# CS 3500 Lab Submission Repo

## Submission instructions

Make sure that your entire solution is contained in the directory `src/main/java/student`. All of your tests should be contained in a single test class. Each time that you make a `git push` into this repository, Pawtograder will automatically run the autograder script on your code. You'll find the results in Pawtograder, with a link to the results in the `Actions` tab.
